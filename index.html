                <p>Dogs are man's best friend in the animal kingdom, but have you ever wondered
                    how old you are relative to your dog's age, or how old your dog is relative
                    to your age?

            <p>NB: The calculation is not rocket science: since dogs generally reach adulthood

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first 2 years of a dog's life count as 10.5 dog years each.</li>
                <li>Each year following equates to 4 dog years</li>
